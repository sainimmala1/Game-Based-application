Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Overview

This project is a static webpage featuring two modes for playing the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

JavaScript Mode: Users can select their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer generates a random choice to determine the 
                 winner.
                 
Teachable Machine Integration: Utilizes Google's Teachable Machine for real-time gesture recognition, enabling users to play by showing 
                               hand gestures for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The application recognizes the gestures and determines the 
                               outcome.
